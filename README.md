Finite Difference Option Pricer
# PDE Option Pricing - Black Scholes Model  - using Finite Difference method

The python file allows the user to compute the price of any payoff using the Finite Difference method. <br>
 
* **Python file**: the user shall create a class (using the main parameters of an option), that contains the desired payoff. For instance, to create a payoff vector, user should first define the boundary conditions vector, pass it thourgh the exponential function and finally, use this vector as the argument of a payoff function.

* **Excel file (in construction)**: The Excel file is built to be a more user-friendly interface. The user can input the parameters directly to the cells. However, for more flexibility, the payoff vector should be computed manually by the user. A simple click on the pricing button should return the price.
